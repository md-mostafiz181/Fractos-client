    "detail":"In the earliest moments of our universe, before galaxies or stars or anything else we recognize had come into being, there was the Big Bang. Matter and energy exploded out of an infinitesimally small and infinitely dense point and expanded rapidly to exponentially larger sizes, creating the building blocks of the universe.But there are researchers who have now proposed that it’s not where everything started. Because there’s a category of “stuff” that doesn’t really follow the rules of everything else—dark matter.In a recent preprint, researchers from the University of Texas propose the idea of a second Big Bang, which they call a “Dark Big Bang.” Thought to have happened significantly after the regular Big Bang (which they call the Hot Big Bang), the researchers argue that this could be where dark matter came from. We only know dark matter exists because we can see the effects of its gravity. It pulls on the things around it in such a way that we know it’s there, even if we don’t know what it is. But that’s the only interaction we’ve seen, and according to this study, there should be a lot more if dark matter and normal matter were created at the same time. “If such non-gravitational interactions existed one would expect the Hot Big Bang to produce not only the visible matter and radiation, but also the dark matter,” said Martin Winkler, the other lead author on this study.But, Winkler told Popular Mechanics, “despite enormous experimental efforts for decades, no non-gravitational interactions of dark matter have been detected. If gravity is the only force between dark and visible matter (or if only extremely weak non-gravitational forces exist between them), there is no reason for the Hot Big Bang to produce the dark matter.”So, the researchers proposed that a second Big Bang, a Dark Big Bang, may have produced the dark matter up to a month after the Hot Big Bang produced everything else. It would have created a burst of hot, dark plasma that eventually bubbled out into dark particles, just like we imagine the regular Big Bang would have created the particles with which scientists are already familiar.
