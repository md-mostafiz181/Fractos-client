That is why they are observable only under a microscope. There are three main types of bacteria, which are classified according to their shape.The bacilli are a group of bacteria that occur in the soil and air. They are shaped like ords. If we look at them under a microscope, we find them in motion. they always seem to be rolling or tumbling under the microscope.These bacilli are largely responsible for food spoilage. There is another group of bacteria who tend to grow in chains. They are referred to as the cocci group. A common example of this type is streptococci that causes strep throat. Finally, there is the spiral shaped bacteria called spirilla. They look a little like corkscrews, and they are responsible for a number of diseases in humans.Some species of bacteria cause disease, but mostly bacteria live hannlessly on the skin, in the mouth, and the intestines. ln fact, bacteria are very helpful to researchers.Bacterial cells resemble the cells of other life forms in many ways, and may be studied to give us insights",
